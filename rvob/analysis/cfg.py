    Builds the CFG of the supplied assembly code, starting from the specified entry point.
    
    The entry point consists of a valid label pointing to what will be considered by the algorithm as the first
    instruction executed by a caller.

    The resulting graph's nodes either contain a reference to a view, through the node attribute `block`, which
    represents the block of serial instructions associated with the node, or an `external` flag, signifying that the
    referenced code is external to the analyzed code.

    Nodes are connected through unweighted edges bearing a `kind` attribute, which describes the type of transition that
    that edge represents.
